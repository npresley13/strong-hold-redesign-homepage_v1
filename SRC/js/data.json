This cabinet features polypropylene bins on both the doors and body. There are 110 total bins and 94 (4 1/8 in. w  x 7 3/8 in. d x 3 in. h) of them have a capacity of 10 lbs and the other 16 (8 1/4 in. w x 14 3/4 in. d x 7 in. h) bins have a capacity of 60 lbs each. In addition, the cabinet also has 3 shelves that have a weight capacity of 1900 lbs each. Smaller items can be stored in the bins while your large parts and tools will easily fit on the shelves, making it a versatile storage solution.\n\nYour equipment is secured by a 3-point locking system. The steel handle is compatible with standard padlocks and can also be equipped with a digital keypad for keyless entry. 8 GA leaf hinges support the full-length doors with stainless steel hinge pins. These hinge pins ensure rust free, smooth operations. The 7 GA legs feature floor anchoring plates and stand at 6 in. tall, allowing for smooth forklift transportation.\n\nShipped fully assembled, this cabinet is immediately ready for use.
